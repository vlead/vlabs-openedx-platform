  3. Use =new_lab_id= and make a request to [[http://lds-alpha.base4.vlabs.ac.in][LDS]] service to
     get the lab information. Use below syntax to make a
     request to LDS and replace =<new-lab-id>= with
     =new_lab_id= value
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     firefox http://lds-alpha.base4.vlabs.ac.in/labs?lab_id=<new-lab-id>
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     Above command must result a json record with lab
     information
  4. From the step(3) get the lab_name and download the
     appropriate course from the [[http://files.vlabs.ac.in/downloads/edx-tar-balls/][link]]
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     wget http://files.vlabs.ac.in/downloads/edx-tar-balls/<open-edx-data-structures-iiith>.tar.gz
     #+END_EXAMPLE
     In above example replace
     =<open-edx-data-structures-iiith>= with selected file
  5. Access the Openedx URL
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     firefox http://10.2.56.229:18010
     #+END_EXAMPLE
  6. Use below given credentials to login into the OpenedX
     studio
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     honor@example.com -- > Sripathi,  Madhavi
     audit@example.com ---> Sravanthi M, Raghupathi
     verified@example.com --- > Sanchitha , Mrudhvika
     staff@example.com ---> Shiva, Balamma

  11. Change lab_id and exp_id in all feedback integrations
